## Welcome to the Jones Group GitHub

We are the **Jones Group** at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, exploring how normal cells evolve as they acquire mutations through ageing and environmental exposures, and how these changes set the stage for cancer.  

Our research combines **deep sequencing, gene editing, 3D tissue culture, live imaging, single-cell analysis, and quantitative modelling** to uncover how mutant cells compete, persist, or are eliminated within normal tissues such as the skin and oesophagus.  

We focus on three key areas:  
- üß¨ **Mutations in normal tissues** ‚Äì mapping how mutations accumulate with age, lifestyle, and environmental factors.  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Competitive fitness of mutant cells** ‚Äì identifying mutations that give cells an advantage and exploring ways to selectively remove them.  
- üî¨ **Earliest stages of tumour development** ‚Äì visualising how micro-tumours emerge, compete, and sometimes regress before progressing to cancer.  

By understanding these Darwinian-like evolutionary processes, we aim to develop strategies that **redirect selection pressures** to reduce harmful mutations and ultimately **prevent cancer before it starts**.  

This GitHub organisation hosts our computational tools, analysis pipelines, and models that support our mission to decode the evolutionary dynamics of normal and pre-cancerous tissues.
